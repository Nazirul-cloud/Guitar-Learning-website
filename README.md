## About Learning Guitar
* Even total rock stars can be low on confidence. Don't let it hold you back, instead accept it's natural. You're only human. You're self-belief will grow.
* Learn as much as you can, work on those core techniques and tomorrow you could be writing your own Purple Haze.
* My first love was the sound of guitar.
